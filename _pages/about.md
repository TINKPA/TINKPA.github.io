Hello! I'm a senior at UCLA, majoring in Mathematics of Computation. I am deeply interested in the intersection of theoretical concepts and real-world applications, particularly within the realm of data mining, machine learning, and various other fields. As I navigate the journey of applying to graduate schools in data mining, I am eager to contribute and learn from innovative research environments.
